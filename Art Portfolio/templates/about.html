        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>ðŸ“œ Our History
            How It All Started
            In 2020, our journey began with a simple ideaâ€”to create a digital space where artists could showcase their work without limitations. What started as a small online gallery soon gained traction, attracting artists from different corners of the world.
            
            Growth & Expansion
            By 2021, we had built a thriving community of creators, and our portfolio was recognized with the Best Art Portfolio Award. In 2022, we were featured in Art Magazine, and in 2023, we successfully hosted our first International Art Exhibition, showcasing over 500+ artworks from talented artists.
            
            The Road Ahead
            Today, we continue to expand our platform, fostering an inclusive space for emerging and established artists. Our mission remains the sameâ€”to inspire, connect, and empower artists worldwide.</p>
